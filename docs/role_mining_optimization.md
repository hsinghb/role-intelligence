# Role Mining & Optimization

This module uses machine learning to discover optimal role structures and suggest improvements.

## Purpose
- Discover hidden patterns in user-permission assignments.
- Suggest merging, splitting, or removing roles for optimal access control.

## Key Functions
- `mine_roles(user_permission_matrix)`: Clusters users based on permission usage.
- `suggest_role_optimizations()`: Recommends role changes.

## Inputs
- User-permission assignment data (matrix or list).

## Outputs
- Suggested role definitions and optimization actions.

## Algorithms
- **Clustering:** DBSCAN or similar algorithms to group users by permission similarity.
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF vectorization of permissions.
- **Similarity:** Cosine similarity to compare user access patterns.

## Example Usage
```python
clusters = role_miner.mine_roles(user_permission_matrix)
suggestions = role_miner.suggest_role_optimizations()
```
